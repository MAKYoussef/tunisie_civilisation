\## An Academic Static Website on Ancient Tunisian History



This project is a small, static website created for a Web Programming 1 course (2024-2025). It presents the major civilizations that shaped Tunisia's history, from the Stone Age (Capsian civilization, 8th millennium BC) to the Muslim Conquest (7th century AD).



The site details each historical period, including its \*\*vestiges\*\* (ruins, monuments) and major \*\*historical events\*\*.

\## ðŸ›  Technologies Used



This site was built using only core static web technologies, without any ready-to-use frameworks:



\* \*\*HTML5\*\* : Used for a \*\*semantic structure\*\* (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).

\* \*\*CSS3\*\* : Used for all styling and layout.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Layout\*\* : \*\*Flexbox\*\* was used extensively and was mandatory for arranging major page elements.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Design\*\* : The site features a \*\*responsive design\*\* achieved through \*\*Media Queries\*\* to adapt to different screen sizes.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Styling\*\* : A variety of CSS selectors (ID, classes, nested, `nth-child`) were used across two separate stylesheets for visual unity.
